# SuperJSON
SuperJSON - SuperBMD Material Editor

It's all done with a GUI (Graphical User Intereface)
The GUI is pretty user friendly, but if you need help, you can ask me on Discord: https://discord.gg/9JRaaem

This program would not be possible without the following helping hands: @Gamma, @RenolY2, Riidefi, and SY24.

# What does it do:
SuperJSON edits SuperBMD Materials so you can make your SMS, SMG1/2/ ect. models look spectacular.

# How to get a material .JSON:
Use SuperBMD Version 1.3.6 or higher to dump the contents of a BMD/BDL model file.

# How do I use this thing?
